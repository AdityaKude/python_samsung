    # Step 1: Sort both the boys' and girls' heights arrays to ensure they are in non-decreasing order.
    b.sort()  # Sort the boys' heights
    g.sort()  # Sort the girls' heights
    
    # Step 2: Try to interlace the boys and girls in two possible patterns:
    # Pattern 1: Boy first, Girl second
    pattern1 = []  # To store the interlaced pattern starting with boy
    for i in range(len(b)):
        pattern1.append(b[i])  # Add a boy
        pattern1.append(g[i])  # Add a girl

    for i in range(len(b)):
        pattern2.append(g[i])  # Add a girl
        pattern2.append(b[i])  # Add a boy
    
    # Step 3: Define a helper function to check if a given list is in non-decreasing order.
    def is_valid(arr):
        # Loop through the array starting from index 1 and check if each element
        # is greater than or equal to the previous element.
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:  # If any element is smaller than the previous one, it's invalid.
                return False
        return True  # If no violations are found, it's valid.
    
    # Step 4: Check if either of the interlaced patterns is valid.
    # If either pattern is valid, return "YES" and the valid arrangement, otherwise return "NO".
    if is_valid(pattern1):
        return "YES", pattern1  # Return YES with the valid arrangement (Pattern 1)
    elif is_valid(pattern2):
        return "YES", pattern2  # Return YES with the valid arrangement (Pattern 2)
    else:
        return "NO", []  # Return NO if no valid pattern is found

# Example usage:
b = [150, 160, 170]  # Heights of boys
g = [155, 165, 175]  # Heights of girls
result, arrangement = can_arrange_students(b, g)
print(result)  # Output: YES
print(arrangement)  # Output: [150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175]



# Explanation:
# Sorting: We first sort both the boys' heights (b) and girls' heights (g).
# Since the problem states the heights are in non-decreasing order, this step ensures that 
# the heights are sorted, even if not given initially.

# Two Interlacing Patterns:
# We consider two possible interlacing patterns:
# Pattern 1: Start with a boy and alternate with a girl.
# Pattern 2: Start with a girl and alternate with a boy.

# Validation: We then check if any of the two interlaced patterns are valid 
# by ensuring the heights are in non-decreasing order.

# Return Result: If either pattern is valid, we return "YES", otherwise "NO".

# Time Complexity:
# Sorting the two lists takes O(n log n), where n is the number of boys (or girls).
# Checking the interlaced sequence takes O(n).
# Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), which should be efficient enough for most inputs.

# Example Walkthrough:
# Input:
# Boys' heights: [150, 160, 170]
# Girls' heights: [155, 165, 175]

# Output:
# After sorting:
# Boys' heights: [150, 160, 170]
# Girls' heights: [155, 165, 175]

# Pattern 1 (Boy first):
# Sequence: [150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175]
# This sequence is in non-decreasing order, so the result is "YES".

# Pattern 2 (Girl first):
# Sequence: [155, 150, 165, 160, 175, 170]
# This sequence is not in non-decreasing order, so this pattern is invalid.

# Final Result:
# The result is "YES" because Pattern 1 is valid.
